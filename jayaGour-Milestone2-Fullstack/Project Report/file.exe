Milestone 2 – React Product Dashboard with Express Backend

Introduction

This project is a small full-stack application built using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend.
The goal of the project is to display a list of products, view a product’s details, and add new products using a form.
The backend stores the data in a simple JSON file.
The frontend communicates with the backend using API calls.

The project follows all three user stories mentioned in the assessment.

Project Objective

The purpose of the project is to understand:
• how to build components in React
• how to use React Router for navigation
• how to handle forms using Formik and Yup
• how to manage data using Context API
• how to build a backend API using Express
• how to connect React with an API

Technologies Used

Frontend: React, React Router, Bootstrap, Formik, Yup
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Data: JSON file (products.json)

Features Developed
1. Product List Page

The main page shows a list of products.
Each product is displayed inside a card with its name, price and category.
Clicking on “View Details” opens the product detail page.

2. Product Detail Page

When a product is clicked, the detail page shows all information about that product.
The details are loaded using the product ID from the backend API.
This page is lazy-loaded to improve performance.

3. Add Product Page

This page contains a form where users can add a new product.
Formik is used to control the form and Yup is used to validate the inputs.
After submitting the form, the new product is stored in the backend JSON file through a POST API.
The application redirects back to the product list and shows the new product.

4. API Integration

The backend provides three API routes:
• GET /products – returns all products
• GET /products/:id – returns a single product
• POST /products – adds a new product
The frontend uses Axios to call these APIs.

5. Context API

Context API is used to store the product list globally.
When a new product is added, the list updates automatically without reloading the page.

Backend Explanation

The backend is created using Express.
It reads and writes data from a JSON file just like a simple database.
This makes it easy to test GET and POST requests without using real databases.
The backend runs on port 5000.

Frontend Explanation

The frontend is created using create-react-app.
React Router helps in switching between pages.
Bootstrap is used to style the pages.
Formik and Yup make the form easy to handle with validation.
Axios is used for API communication.

How the System Works

The backend starts first and serves the API.

The frontend loads and sends a GET request to the backend.

The backend sends back product data.

When a product is added from the form, a POST request is sent.

The backend stores the new product in the JSON file.

The frontend updates the product list automatically.

Conclusion

This project helped in understanding how the frontend and backend work together.
It covers important concepts like routing, state management, API handling, form validation, and lazy loading.
The application is simple, easy to use, and fulfills all the user stories given in the Milestone-2 assessment.
